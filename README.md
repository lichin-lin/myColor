  Swipe the cards left and right just like using Tinder! swipe left for not interesting, rigth for love it, and up to pass this color.

### Step 2: 🚂🚃 Train 🚃🚃🚃
  Just press Train button and wait for 2~3 second.

### Step 3: 🔷 get the result 🔶
  You can press "Favor" or "Gradient" to get your result.
  ```
  Reminder: sometime the result of training process of Gradient you will get is a notification, it means my network modal is not good enough to generate the gradient. Sorry, you may need to refresh the page and do the swipe process again.
  I will improve the modal in future.
